# IBM-Quantum-Challenge
The IBM Quantum Challenge competition was held from May 4 to May 8. This has the jupyter notebooks I used for excercises 3 and 4.
For excercise 4 my submitted score was 94, I did make the circuit's cost to 51 but unfortunately couldn't submit it as it was past the deadline as you can see the error in the last line of the notebook.
